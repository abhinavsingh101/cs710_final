Hi,

Here are some notes to help you navigate my R code.

1. You should download the zip file from github and then run the R script. 
I have not used file paths and relied on the datasets and the R script being in the same folder.

2. One visualisation's legend is hidden because it shares its legend with another similar visualisation. 
Some other visualisations don't need a legend.
